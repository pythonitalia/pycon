# PyCon Italia website

> The monorepo for the new PyCon Italia website, based on Django, Strawberry,
> NextJS and React.

## How to setup

This project is composed of two services, a backend and a frontend.

Follow the [README in the backend service](./backend/README.md) to setup the
backend.

Note:

Currently in order to run the frontend you also need the backend up and running,
we will, in future, provide a staging environment that can be used for
development, without you having to setup the backend as well.

Follow the [README in the frontend service](./frontend/README.md) to setup the
frontend.
