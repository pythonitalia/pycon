  cityDescription: `
Bologna is one of the most charming cities of Italy, and we love it. Many of our attendees enjoy coming here in autumn, for experiencing the rich history and culinary culture that will forever be an essential part of this place.

Included in the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Music, the historic center of Bologna is a treasure trove of art and architecture.

The PyCon Italia venue is located close to the city center (~1h walk or ~20' bus) and many initiatives will be announced for sharing this treasure with our attendees.
