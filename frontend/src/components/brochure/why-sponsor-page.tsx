        The very first reason is to help the community around this environment
        to grow. Sponsors are what make this conference possible. From low
        ticket prices to financial aid, to video recording, the organizations
        who step forward to support PyCon Italia, in turn, support the entire
        Python community.

        Moreover, many of our sponsoring services have turned towards the
        increased recruiting requests we got in the last years, thatâ€™s why you
        can find several ways of engage potential candidates for the position
        you are looking for in our event.
