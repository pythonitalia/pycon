                        We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to
                        update you on your application for Financial Aid to
                        attend @{{conferenceName}}. The number of requests to
                        the PyCon Italia Financial Aid program was overwhelming
                        this year, and we received more applications than we can
                        accommodate in the program.
                      </p>
                      <p class="m-0 mb-16">
                        For this reason, we regret to inform you that your
                        request for Financial Aid has not been approved.
                      </p>
                      <p class="m-0 mb-16">
                        We understand that attending PyCon Italia is an
                        important opportunity for you, and we are truly sorry
                        for the disappointment this may cause.
                      </p>

                      <p class="m-0 mb-16">
                        We hope to add more resources to our Financial Aid Program and be able to support you next year, as
                        we would be honored to have you join us in the future.
                      </p>
