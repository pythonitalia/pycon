                        As you may be aware, we have had an overwhelming response to our call for proposals,
                        and while we wish we could accommodate everyone, our schedule has limitations.
                      </p>
                      <p class="m-0 mb-16">
                        As we are currently finalizing our speaker lineup,
                        we wanted to inquire if you are still interested in remaining on the waiting list.
                        In the event of any withdrawals or changes to our schedule,
                        speakers from the waiting list will be considered for inclusion.

                          If you are willing to stay on the waiting list,
                          please let us know by replying to this email and also telling us
                          if you have a specific deadline after which you are no longer interested.

                        If you're planning to attend PyCon Italia, regardless of whether you have a talk/workshop or not,
                        we'd love to hear if you're open to the possibility of stepping in for a last-minute talk in case of cancellations!
                        Unfortunately, last-minute issues always happen ü§∑üèª,
                        and your flexibility could really help us out,
                        especially if it's the day before or the same day as the conference.

                        Conversely, if your circumstances have changed or you have secured
                        other commitments that prevent your participation, kindly let us know, and we will update our records accordingly.
