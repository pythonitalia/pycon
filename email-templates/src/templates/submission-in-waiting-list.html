                        We're reaching out to you regarding the status of your submission @{{submissionTitle}} (@{{submissionType}}) at @{{conferenceName}}.
                        <br />
                        As you may be aware, we have had an overwhelming response to our call for proposals,
                        and while we wish we could accommodate everyone, our schedule has limitations.
                        <br />
                        As we are currently finalizing our speaker lineup we wanted to inquire
                        if you are still interested in remaining on the waiting list.
                        In the event of any withdrawals or changes to our schedule,
                        speakers from the waiting list will be considered for inclusion.
                        <br />
                        <strong>If you are available and willing to stay on the waiting list, please reply to this email confirming your continued interest.</strong>
                        Your response will help us ensure we can reach out to you promptly should an opportunity arise.
                        <br />
                        Conversely, if your circumstances have changed or you have secured other commitments that prevent your participation,
                        kindly let us know, and we will update our records accordingly.
                      </p>
                      <p class="m-0 mb-16">
                        Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
                        We truly appreciate your interest in speaking at @{{conferenceName}},
                        and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you as a speaker in the near future.
