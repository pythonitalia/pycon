                        to us before the conference. The reimbursement will be
                        made by a bank transfer after the conference.

                          As part of our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint
                          of the conference we expect our attendees to use
                          trains rather than airplanes when possible. Thus, we
                          will not refund air travel costs when other means of
                          transportation are easily available. This will be
                          considered on a case by case basis. Please consider
                          this when calculating the estimated costs.

                          than half a day, it depends on how many volunteers we
                          can count on - note: talk managers are those staff
                          people in the talk rooms who introduce and help the

                          an eye on timing for starting / ending the talk in
                          time. We have a simple handbook for that don't worry!)
