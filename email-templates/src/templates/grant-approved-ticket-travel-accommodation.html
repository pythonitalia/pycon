                          of the conference we expect our attendees to use
                          trains rather than airplanes when possible. Thus, we
                          will not refund air travel costs when other means of
                          transportation are easily available. This will be
                          considered on a case by case basis. Please consider
                          this when calculating the estimated costs.
